Encoding
A high level view of the encoding algorithm is shown here:

Initialize the dictionary to contain all strings of length one.
Find the longest string W in the dictionary that matches the current input.
Emit the dictionary index for W to output and remove W from the input.
Add W followed by the next symbol in the input to the dictionary.
Go to Step 2.
